# Statistical Modeling in R

## Description of Workshop

This workshop is part of the Data Science Workshops hosted by Research Computing Services at Northwestern University (2020).

The purpose of the workshop is to introduce students in how to conduct statistical modeling with linear, logistic and Poisson regression.

Students are expected to have knowledge of R and regression analysis.

## Packages

This workshop requires packages: **readr, pscl, caret, stats.**

## Downloading Files

### Recommended: Entire directory

You can download all of the files by clicking the green button ("Clone or download") above and choosing "Download ZIP."

### Individual Files

**If you download files from the links above, you have to click through to the RAW version of the R markdown files and download that.  If you download directly from the links above, the files won't open because they are web pages, not the raw files.**

### Downloading Exercises

To download just the exercise files, right-click on the links below, and choose Save Link As (or the similar option in your browser).  Make sure to choose All file types as the content type (or .ipynb if available), and remove any .txt or similar extensions from the file when you save it.  The files should be *.ipynb files, with no additional file type extensions.
